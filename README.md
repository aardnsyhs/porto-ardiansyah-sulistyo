# Portfolio — Ardiansyah Sulistyo

Hey there! 👋

I'm **Ardiansyah Sulistyo**, a web developer who loves building clean, functional, and beautiful web experiences. This is my personal portfolio site where I showcase my work, skills, and a bit about who I am as a developer.

## About This Project

This portfolio is built with a focus on **modern design**, **user experience**, and **performance**. It features a dark-dominant theme with elegant animations and interactions — minimalistic but memorable. I wanted something that feels unique without being over the top.

The site is fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for speed. It's designed to work smoothly on all devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React** — Component-based UI
- **TypeScript** — Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** — Fast build tool and dev server
- **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first styling with a custom design system
- **Lucide Icons** — Clean, modern iconography
- **Recharts** — Data visualization for skills
- **React Router** — Client-side routing

## Features

Here's what makes this portfolio stand out:

- **Typing Effect** — Hero section cycles through my roles and skills
- **Interactive Timeline** — Experience and education displayed in a clean, animated timeline
- **Particle Background** — Subtle animated background that doesn't distract
- **Command Palette** — Press `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac) to quickly navigate
- **Project Modals** — Click on projects to see more details and live previews
- **Animated Stats** — Numbers that count up when you scroll to them
- **Skills Visualization** — Interactive charts showing my technical proficiency
- **Easter Egg** — Hidden surprise for curious visitors (try pressing `Shift+Shift+Shift`)
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Theme toggle with smooth transitions
- **Micro-interactions** — Subtle hover effects and animations throughout
- **Accessibility First** — ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- **Performance Optimized** — Lazy loading, optimized images, and fast load times
- **SEO Ready** — Proper meta tags, Open Graph, sitemap, and structured data
